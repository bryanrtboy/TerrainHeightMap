# TerrainHeightMap
Creating a terrain from GIS data and a heightmap.

This project requires:
* Unity 2022.1.0b6 or higher
* Install Terrain Tools Package
* Download and install the Terrain Samples Pack from the Asset Store

This experiment used USGS Map data that was then worked to create a 16 bit heightmap. Owen Goss provides a great, detailed explanation of how to convert the USGS file into something Unity can use: https://owengoss.medium.com/using-real-world-elevation-data-in-unity-6b2a960401af
